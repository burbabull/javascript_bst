A binary search tree implementation in Javascript. Includes:

1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Find
4. Successor
5. Preorder Traversal
6. Postorder Traversal
7. Inorder Traversal

This implementation does not perform balancing, so performing an insert of ordered elements produces what is in effect a doubly linked list.
